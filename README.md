##  Overview

This project builds a complete machine learning pipeline to predict customer churn for a telecom company. It covers data cleaning, exploratory data analysis, preprocessing, training and comparing three models, and deploying the best one as an interactive **Streamlit** web app where a user can enter customer details and get an instant churn prediction.

---

##  Problem Statement

Customer churn is a major issue for subscription-based businesses, and losing customers directly reduces revenue. Acquiring a new customer is usually more expensive than retaining an existing one.

**Goal:** build a model that identifies customers at high risk of leaving, so the company can take proactive retention measures such as targeted offers, better support, or contract upgrades.

##  Dataset

| Property | Details |
|----------|---------|
| **Source** | IBM Sample Data Sets: Telco Customer Churn |
| **Records** | 7,032 customers (after cleaning) |
| **Features** | 19 (after dropping `customerID`) |
| **Target** | `Churn` (Yes/No, encoded as 1/0) |

The features cover customer demographics, account information (tenure, contract, payment method, charges), and subscribed services (internet, security, tech support, streaming, etc.).

The application predicts customer churn risk based on customer demographics, subscription details, billing information, and service usage.

---

##  Project Workflow

**1. Data Cleaning**
- Dropped the `customerID` column (identifier, no predictive value)
- Converted `TotalCharges` to numeric
- Handled missing values (11 rows dropped)
- Encoded the target `Churn` as 0 and 1

**2. Exploratory Data Analysis**
- Analyzed the churn distribution
- Studied how key features relate to churn

**3. Preprocessing**
- One-Hot Encoding for categorical variables
- 80/20 train-test split with stratification to preserve class ratio
- Feature scaling with `StandardScaler`

**4. Model Building and Evaluation**
- Logistic Regression
- Random Forest
- XGBoost
- Compared using Accuracy, Precision, Recall, F1-Score and ROC-AUC

**5. Deployment**
- Saved the model, scaler and training columns with Joblib
- Built an interactive Streamlit web app

##  Key Insights

- **Contract type matters most:** customers on **month-to-month** contracts have the highest churn rate.
- **Internet service:** **Fiber optic** users churn more than DSL users.
- **Tenure:** customers with **low tenure** are far more likely to leave, so the early months are the critical retention window.
- **Support services:** customers without **Online Security** and **Tech Support** show higher churn.
- **Pricing:** newer customers with **higher monthly charges** are at the greatest risk.

### Business Recommendations
- Offer incentives to move month-to-month customers onto longer contracts.
- Run onboarding and retention campaigns during the first few months.
- Bundle or promote security and tech support add-ons.
- Review pricing and service quality for fiber optic customers.

##  Model Performance

Metrics for the churn class are reported on the held-out 20% test set.

| Model | Accuracy | Precision (Churn) | Recall (Churn) | F1-Score (Churn) | ROC-AUC |
|-------|:--------:|:-----------------:|:--------------:|:----------------:|:-------:|
| **Logistic Regression** | **0.80** | **0.65** | **0.57** | **0.61** | **0.836** |
| Random Forest | 0.79 | 0.62 | 0.51 | 0.56 | 0.816 |
| XGBoost | 0.77 | 0.58 | 0.53 | 0.55 | 0.811 |

** Best model: Logistic Regression**, which scored highest on every metric and was selected for deployment.

> **Note:** The dataset is imbalanced (far fewer churners than non-churners), which limits recall on the churn class. Addressing this with SMOTE and threshold tuning is planned under [Future Improvements](#-future-improvements).

---

## Model Upgrade (Phase 1)

After initial evaluation, the project was improved to better handle **class imbalance** (churn ≈ 27%).

### Problem
Baseline Logistic Regression achieved solid accuracy (0.80) and ROC-AUC (0.836), but **churn recall was only 0.57** — meaning 43% of customers at risk were missed.

### Solution
- Applied **class weighting** (`class_weight="balanced"`) to give the minority class higher importance during training
- Analyzed decision thresholds from 0.30 to 0.60
- Selected **threshold 0.50** for production deployment

### Results

| Metric | Baseline LR | Balanced LR (0.50) | Change |
|--------|-------------|--------------------|--------|
| Churn Recall | 0.57 | **0.80** | +0.23 ↑ |
| Churn Precision | 0.65 | 0.49 | -0.16 ↓ |
| ROC-AUC | 0.836 | 0.835 | ~0 |
| Accuracy | 0.80 | 0.73 | -0.07 ↓ |

**Trade-off:** We improved recall significantly at the cost of precision and accuracy. For churn prediction, missing a customer at risk is costlier than an extra retention offer, so this trade-off is intentional.

##  Streamlit App

The app lets a user enter customer details (contract, tenure, internet service, charges, add-on services, etc.) and returns:

- the predicted outcome (**will churn / will not churn**)
- the churn probability
